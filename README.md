# NOBERRY
(WIP) Use your phone as a Blackberry-like feature phone!
## WIP! ONLY CREATED A REPOSITORY! NO CODE WRITTEN! PLEASE, UNDERSTAND!
The project is work in progress, anything can change. It's inspired by the concept of SFQMI Beepberry/Beepy - building a weekend feature phone to not procrastinate.
Also inspired by the nothing os design, but there would be no dots.
## Notice:
if you hope that this will end up developing quickly, no. This is my rather personal project that is going to be my kotlin learning project, where i'll be learning this language all along the development.
