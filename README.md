# NOBERRY
(WIP) Use your phone as a Blackberry-like feature phone!
## WIP! ONLY CREATED A REPOSITORY! NO CODE WRITTEN! PLEASE, UNDERSTAND!
The project is work in progress, anything can change. It's inspired by the concept of SFQMI Beepberry/Beepy - building a weekend feature phone to not procrastinate.
Also inspired by the nothing os design, but there would be no dots.
